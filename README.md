## Student folder

### Create a class
Create class named Student with following public properties:

- name

- fNumber

and methods:

- takeExam()

This method should implement logic for printing out the following message: "Taking exam".



Note: name and fNumber are assigned in class constructor.

### Inherit a class

1. Create two classes:

- Mathematician

Add property certification to this class.



- Athlete



2. These two classes should inherit Student class.



3. Update Student class by adding new property attendance (заверка). Consider the best type for this property.

### Encapsulation task

1. Update all properties in Student class in order to be accessed by the sub-clasess which inherit it but not visible in different package.



2. Update certification property in Mathematician class in order not to be inherited by any potential sub-class.



3. Considering the statements above, update Mathematician class in order certification property to be set by external class (do not use public modifier).

### Method overloading and overriding

1. Overload takeExam() method in order to perform the following tasks:

- checking if attendance of the student is true (consider for which student the overloading is applicable)

- depending of the check above, print the message that the exam is passed. If the check fails, print a message that the exam is not passed.



2. Override takeExam() method in order to:

- set value to certification property to true and print a message that the exam is passed.

### Interface task

1. Create interface Practice with method training.

2. Mathematician and Athlet classes should implement Practice interface.



Note: Please consider right syntax of extending class and implementing an interface.

## Datatypes
